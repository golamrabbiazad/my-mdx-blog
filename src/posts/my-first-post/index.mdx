TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
Writing types can be optional in TypeScript, because type inference allows you to get a lot of power without writing additional code.
